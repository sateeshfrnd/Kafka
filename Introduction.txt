Main components of Kafka
========================
- Kafka maintains feeds of messages in categories called 'Topics'.
- Processes that publish messages to a Kafka Topic are called 'Producers'.
- Processes that subscribe to topics and read the message feed are called 'Consumers'.
- Kafka is configured on a cluster of one or more servers where each one acts as a 'Broker'.
- Apache ZooKeeper is an open source service built to coordinate and synchronize configuration information of nodes that belong to a distributed system. A Kafka cluster depends on ZooKeeper to perform—among other things—operations such as detecting failed nodes and electing leaders.

Note: Communication between client and kafka brokers are using TCP protocol.
